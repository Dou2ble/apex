# THIS IS VERY WIP

## very breif overview of what everything here is
The `chroot` folder contains files in order to create a merelinux chroot enviornment that is used to build packages. NOTE: this is only a temporary measure. Once enough packages are built in order to be able to create a apexlinux chroot it will be used instead of the merelinux chroot.
